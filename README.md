Here we will get the latest information about the students and staffs. This generic application is designed for assisting the students of the college, regarding information on the courses, subjects, classes, assignments, grades and timetable. 
  
  The purpose of  a Website is not only limited to attracting and encouraging high school students to take coursework at Viswabrahmana college but it also aims to provide information about institute keeping in mind that the person visiting this website wants a full knowledge of the college. Here administrator will manage the accounts of the student and faculties, makes the timetable, and upload the latest information about the campus. 
  
  Due to increased use of the internet in the decision-making process and selection of universities by potential students, websites play important role in student decisions to consider and attend any specific university. Since utilization of the internet is more important to the younger generation than older students, College must possess attractive and clearly understood webpage with readily navigable information on such characteristics as programs, course offerings, location, and relevant accreditations. This is critically important as visiting the website and what was found there was a precursor to a decision to visit the campus. This project is aimed at developing website that will help the users to access the information instantly.
